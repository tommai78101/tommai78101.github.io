title: Busy Busy Life!
---

This is what happens when you left your previous job for a new job, and now things are getting much more hectic. A senior developer has just left the company, and he took his time for us and did a knowledge transfer. As a result, there is no one left to take his place. This senior developer is the person who chose me and was part of the hiring process, so I guess I should thank him for giving me the opportunity. Wish him well in his new role.

Even though I do enjoy my new job, I have fears that I might not be able to keep up, considering how turbulent the developer group had gone through in the past. Hopefully, nothing bad happens in the foreseeable future, and hopefully the last of the turbulent times has passed.

And, because of this busy life, I didn't have much time to commit to my personal project, which is writing an OpenGL book. I hoped all those who are waiting for the next chapter are patient enough.
