I am currently working on a new assignment for my extra credit. 

It was inspired by a Javascript engine called Perlenspiel, which is an in-house rendering engine for game development classes here at WPI.

The name of the project is currently assigned as "Rotation," which the whole premise is to rotate the world around until you are able to find 
the exit.

Currently, it's still being worked on. I have the player's core mechanics finished and now moving on to working on objects in the game.

I haven't thought about how the player wins the game. Vice versa for losing the game.
