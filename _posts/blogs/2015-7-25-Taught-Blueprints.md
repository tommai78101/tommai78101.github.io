title: I taught a lecture!
---

It's my first time experiencing what it's like to be a lecturer. The lesson that I taught to the high school kids is about how to use Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints and Scripting in general.

It may have been one super-duper advanced topics for them to understand, at least a few of them are willing to try it out. I know one of them is interested in using the blueprints to make a snowy mountain.

Also, Agar.io is really addicting. I would recommend.
