title: Was Offered a Part-Time Job!
---

Yay! I have just accepted a job offer to be the lab admin at my school. It's at least something that's worth being productive for the next two semesters.

As with my Master's project, since it's catered to become a multiplayer game, perhaps it would be a good idea to invest my time in learning how to do a multiplayer game. One game engine that I find more common other than Unreal Engine 4 is Unity. I haven't tried it yet, but it feels like it has stable multiplayer features. Going to start working on that before I start school.
