title: Sharing a tip when using Unity Networking (UNET)
---

For those of you learning how to use Unity Networking, or UNET for short, here's a template that I created that will help you learn the basics of using UNET.

    using UnityEngine.Networking;
     
    public class CustomScript : NetworkBehaviour {
        [ServerCallback]
        public void ServerStuff(GameObject newObject, Vector3 newObjectPosition){
            //Do server-side stuff. Initializing all game stuffs can be used here. 
            //Syncing objects can also be used here.
     
            //Let's pretend "newObject" has NetworkTransform attached.
            newObject.transform.position = newObjectPosition;
     
            //Now newObject's NetworkTransform will sync the new position across all
            //connected clients. The values are updated on the server
            //side, all clients will have their old positions marked as Dirty() and
            //will update to the server's values.
        }
     
        [ClientCallback]
        public void ClientStuff(){
            //Do client-side stuff.
     
            //Client may have this registered prefab from the Network Manager, but 
            //usually it's better to have it available in the Hierarchy before 
            //continuing. Usually, it's assigned directly through the Inspector,
            //but let's go with this.
            GameObject prefabObject = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("SamplePrefab");
            if (prefabObject != null){
                //Always check for null. In UNET, there may be times where the 
                //object is not spawned through NetworkServer, thus the object
                //will be missing.
                CmdDoAction(prefabObject);
            }
        }
     
        [Command]
        public void CmdDoAction(GameObject objectToUse){
            //This is where you would do stuffs that the client wants the server
            //to do.
            GameObject obj = Instantiate<GameObject>(objectToUse);
            NetworkServer.SpawnWithClientAuthority(obj, this.connectionToClient);
     
            //Or just have the server do something for the client.
            obj = Instantiate<GameObject>(objectToUse);
            NetworkServer.Spawn(obj);
            ServerStuff(obj, new Vector3(0f, 10f, 0f));
     
            //Once the server has done whatever it needs to do, you can choose if
            //you want to have all clients do other actions.
            RpcDoAction();
        }
     
        [ClientRpc]
        public void RpcDoAction(){
            //Do broadcasting stuffs. Stuffs where all clients (local clients = 
            //LAN host, and remote clients = LAN clients) will do.
     
            //Because there exists a game object with client authority (meaning 
            //the game object's NetworkIdentity has "Local Player Authority"
            //property enabled), it means it's better to check for 
            //NetworkBehaviour.hasAuthority, rather than 
            //NetworkBehaviour.isLocalPlayer.
            if (!this.hasAuthority){
                //Clients with no authority do stuffs here.
     
                //Or if you want, you can do something that all other clients
                // without authority of this game object can do.
                Ping(new Vector3(0f, 10f, 0f), Color.red);
            }
            else {
                //Do something in which the client itself has control over the
                // game object of local authority.
     
                //Then do whatever you need to do that tells the player the unit
                //has spawned, and all other enemies have taken notice of it.
                Ping(new Vector3(0f, 10f, 0f), Color.green);
            }
            return;
        }
     
        public void Ping(Vector3 position, Color color){
            //Pretend this is a function which pings a colored ! symbol on a
            //minimap.
        }
     
        public void Update(){
            //Because this is a custom NetworkBehaviour script, this is attached
            //to a game object that the client may use.
            if (Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0)){
                //When something occurred...
                ClientStuff();
            }
        }
    }
        
Hope this helps.
