#### My own primer on Light Diffusing

Before we delve in on light diffusing, I need to remind of myself about color blending, particularly

For a given light source, S, when I shine the directional light onto a surface, the diffuse intensity of the light is determined by the dot product of the directional light vector and the reflection vector.

That dot product must then multiplied multiple times by itself.
