Finally did it!

I have completed a game project using Dragonfly engine for UNIX text-based NCurses, written in C++. 

This project was made for an independent study group for an undergraduate course. Since I have completed the IMGD 3000 course, my professor said I just need to create a new game, since I have completed all the necessary extra credit curriculums before taking IMGD 4000.

So yay!
