title: Master's Project Update
---

It's been 1 semester right now, estimated to be 3 months or so.

Here's my current update for my Master's Project:

![](https://giant.gfycat.com/SelfreliantPointlessAustralianshelduck.gif)

* Project title is temporarily named as "Multiplier." It references how units in the game can split and merge.   
* As of October 23, 2015, the project has been rewritten from scratch to migrate to the new Unity Networking API (UNET), thus deprecating the old Unity Networking API. This means the old project is therefore discontinued and would not be favorable, since Unity 5 is continuously evolving.    
* Has single player. Players can compete with the game AI players.    
* Has multiplayer. Players can compete against each other through the use of UNET.

You can play the game [here](http://tom-mai78101.itch.io/multiplier). (Please use IE11/Safari/Firefox. The game currently uses Unity Web Player, which is sufficient for multiplayer at the moment.)

There's going to be more update blog posts regarding my project soon.
