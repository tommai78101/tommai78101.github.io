I'm happy with how this is turning out, as I'm just starting out with blogging. In order for me to venture on and make updates, I need some sort of a blog to keep relevant info and knowledge around.

As I continue, I will probably add a few screenshots and GIFs to keep track of what I'm doing, so as not to miss out on anything I was doing for the past few days before that post. Like so:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/first_blog_pic_1.png)

Where can I find all of these emoticons? If I know some of them, I'll be updating this blog and will get the info posted below. :point_down:

Other than that, all handy formatting are similar to Github Markdowns, so I should be set.
