I got myself an Animal Crossing Bundle with New Nintendo 3DS!

I also bought myself 2 new games, Pok√©mon Super Mystery Dungeon and Yokai Watch. These two game are RPG, and I will be trying them out soon.

Hopefully, I don't get too careless of myself, but, since it's the holidays, I could take my time off and play.
